# Dates revisited

## Converting to `Date` class

In the `as.Date` call, the `format` option should tell R what the format **currently** looks like, not what you'd like it to look like. If you don't, you'll get an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
as.Date("Sept. 28, 2015")
```
```
Error in charToDate(x) : 
  character string is not in a standard unambiguous format
```
```{r}
as.Date("Sep. 28, 2015", format = "%b. %d, %Y")
```

"unambiguous format" = "I don't know what to do with this"

## Converting to `Date` class

There are only two date formats that R can read by itself, without you using the `format` option to tell R how to interpret the character string. Those are:

```{r}
as.Date("2015-09-28")
as.Date("2015/09/28")
```

## Converting to `Date` class

A strategy for writing up the `format` code is to copy one of your date observations and then go through and change each element to its formatting code, one at a time:

```
format = "Sep. 28, 2015"
format = "%b. 28, 2015"
format = "%b. %d, 2015"
format = "%b. %d, %Y"
```

Leave any spaces and punctuation from the original observation.

## Converting to `Date` class

Why is R so picky about this? It prevents errors. 

Suppose you had the date March 2, 1981, in this format: "03-02-1981". If R assumed the format was day-month-year, it would mis-interpret this date as February 3, 1981. By insisting on `format`, R protects you from errors like this. 

```{r}
as.Date("03-02-1981", format = "%m-%d-%Y")
as.Date("03-02-1981", format = "%d-%m-%Y")
```

## Printing `Date` class objects

The default is for R to print out dates as "%Y-%m-%d":

```{r}
ex_date <- as.Date("Sep. 28, 2015", format = "%b. %d, %Y")
ex_date
```

If you want it to print out in a different format, you can use the `format` function:

```{r}
format(ex_date, format = "%Y %B %d")
```

## Printing `Date` class objects

Note that the `format` function will convert your date object to a character class of the format you specified:

```{r}
ex_date <- format(ex_date, format = "%Y %B %d")
ex_date
class(ex_date)
```

You would only want to use it when you're ready to save your data back to a flat file. Once you use it, the object won't act like a date in R anymore, since it's been converted to a character class.

# Reproducible research

## What is reproducible research?

**Reproducible**: Could someone else re-do your entire analysis?

- Data available
- All code for cleaning raw data
- All code and software (specific versions, packages) for analysis

The *Methods* section of the future...

## Why is it important?

If your research is reproducible, it means:

- You can (easily) figure out what you did six months from now.
- You can (easily) make adjustments to code or data, even early in the process, and re-run all analysis.
- When you're ready to publish, you can (easily) do a last double-check of your full analysis, from cleaning the raw data through generating figures and tables for the paper.
- You can pass along (or share) a project with others.
- You can give useful code examples to people who want to extend your research.

## Why is it important?

A cautionary example:

## Why is it important?

A cautionary example:

- [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21528593)
- [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/health/research/08genes.html?_r=0)
- [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/02/27/the-duke-saga-starter-set/)

## First steps to making research reproducible

- Include original, "raw" data in your project directory. Include information on where it came from.
- Include all code, as well as a description of the process for running all the code.
- Limit or eliminate all "non-scriptable" steps (i.e., avoid doing anything by hand). If any exist, document them clearly.

# R Style

## Why is style important?

- Clean code is easier to read and interpret later.
- It's easier to catch and fix mistakes when code is clear.
- Others can more easily follow and adapt your code if it's clean.
- Some style guidelines will help prevent possible problems (e.g., use of `attach()`).

## Style guideline review

Building on a few guidelines we've already seen:

- Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment.
- Do not use `attach()`.
- Guidelines for naming objects:
    + All lowercase letters or numbers
    + Use underscore (`_`) to separate words, not camelCase or a dot (`.`)
    + Give meaningful objects meaningful names
    + Have some consistent names to use for "throw-away" objects (e.g., `df`, `ex`, `a`, `b`)

## Line length

Google: **Keep lines to 80 characters or less**

To set your script pane to be limited to 80 characters, go to "RStudio" -> "Preferences" -> "Code" -> "Display", and set "Margin Column" to 80.

```{r eval = FALSE}
my_df <- data.frame(n = 1:3, letter = c("a", "b", "c"), cap_letter = c("A", "B", "C"))

my_df <- data.frame(n = 1:3,
                    letter = c("a", "b", "c"),
                    cap_letter = c("A", "B", "C"))
```

## Spacing

Hadley Wickham: 

- Put spaces around binary operators, like `<-`, `+`, `-`.
- Put a space after a comma, but not before.
- Don't put spaces around colons (`:`).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = T)
diamonds[5, ]
1:10
# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=T)
diamonds[5,]
1 : 10
```

## Semicolons

Although you can use a semicolon to put two lines of code on the same line, you should avoid it. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
a <- 1:10
b <- 3
# Bad
a <- 1:10; b <- 3
```

## Commenting

- For a comment on its own line, use a single `#`, then a space, then the comment. 
- You can put a short comment at the end of a line of R code. In this case, put two spaces after the end of the code, one `#`, and one more space before the comment.
- Hadley Wickham: "Use commented lines of - and = to break up your file into easily readable chunks."

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```

## Indentation

Google:

- When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.
- Exception: When a line break occurs inside parentheses, align the wrapped line with the first character inside the parenthesis.

Example from Hadley Wickham:

```{r eval = FALSE}
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}
```

## Code grouping

- Group related pieces of code together. 
- Separate blocks of code by empty spaces.

```{r eval = TRUE}
# Load data
library(faraway)
data(nepali)

# Relabel sex variable
nepali$sex <- factor(nepali$sex, 
                     levels = c(1, 2),
                     labels = c("Male", "Female"))
```

## Broader guidelines

- Omit needless code.
- Don't repeat yourself.

# Markdown

## Mark-up languages

In Word, you can add formatting using buttons and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., "Ctrl-B" for bold). The file saves the words you type. It also saves the formatting, but you see the final output, rather than the formatting markup, when you edit the file.

In mark-up languages, you markup the document directly to show what formatting the final version should have (e.g., `**bold**` for **bold**).

## Mark-up languages

Examples of mark-up languages include:

- markdown
- html
- LaTex

## Mark-up languages

For example, here's some marked-up html code from CSU's front page:

![](figures/example_html.png)

## Mark-up languages

And here's how it looks when it's rendered by a web browser:

![](figures/example_output.png)

## Markdown conventions

Code     | Rendering
---------|------------
`**text**` | **text** (bold)
`*text*`   | *text* (italics)
``text``   | `text` (computer code)
`[text](www.google.com)` | [text](www.google.com) (link)
`# text`   | First-level header
`## text`  | Second-level header

## Markdown conventions

For more Markdown conventions, you can click on the question mark on the panel of an .Rmd script and choose "Markdown Quick Reference". 

Some other simple things you can do:

- Lists (ordered or bulleted)
- Equations
- Tables
- Outside figures

# `knitr` and RMarkdown

## Literate programming

*Literate programming* mixes code that can be executed with regular text. 

The files you create can then be run, in order, through a few different compilers. The final output will have results from your code and the regular text.

## Literate programming with `knitr`

## Basics

- To open a new RMarkdown file, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "RMarkdown..." -> for now, chose a "Document" in "HTML" format.
- The file extension for RMarkdown files is ".Rmd"
- Once you "knit", there will be an HTML file with the output in the same directory where you've saved your .Rmd file.
- Write everything besides code in markdown syntax.

## More basics

- All the code in the file will run "from scratch"-- as if you just opened a new R session.
- The code will run using the directory where you saved the .Rmd as the working directory.

## Chunk syntax

To include R code in an RMarkdown document, separate off the code chunk using the following syntax:

<pre><code>```{r}
my_vec <- 1:10
```</pre></code>

## Naming chunks

You can specify a name for each chunk, if you'd like, by including it after "r" when you begin your chunk:

<pre><code>```{r load_nepali}
library(faraway)
data(nepali)
```</code></pre>

If you name chunks, it will be easier to find any errors. Any chunks you don't name are given numbers by `knitr`.

Chunk names must be unique.

## Chunk options

You can add options when you start a chunk.

TRUE / FALSE options you might want to use include:

Option    | Action
--------- | -----------------------
`echo`    | Print out the R code?
`eval`    | Run the R code?
`messages` | Print out messages?
`warnings` | Print out warnings?
`include` | If FALSE, run, but don't print code or results

## Chunk options

Other options you might want to include:

Option    | Action
--------- | -----------------------
`results` | How to print results (e.g., `hide` runs the code, but doesn't print the results)
`fig.width` | Width to print your figure, in inches (e.g., `fig.width = 4`)
`fig.height` | Height to print your figure

## Chunk options

Add these options in the opening brackets and separate multiple ones with commas:

<pre><code>```{r  messages = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
nepali[1, 1:3]
```</code></pre>

There are other options as well, but we'll save discussion of those for later in the course.

## Global options

You can set "global" options at the beginning of the document. This will create new defaults for all of the chunks in the document. 

<pre><code>```{r global_options}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE, fig.path = `Figs/`)
```</code></pre>

## Global options

Chunk options take precedence over global options.

For example:

<pre><code>```{r global_options}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE, fig.path = `Figs/`)
```</code></pre>

<pre><code>```{r echo = TRUE}
head(nepali, 1)
```</code></pre>

would print the code for the `check_nepali` chunk.

## Inline code

You can also include R output directly in your text ("inline"):

>There are`` `r '\x60r nrow(nepali)\x60'` `` observations in the `nepali` dataset. The average age is `` `r '\x60r mean(nepali$age, na.rm = TRUE)\x60'` `` months.

Compiled, this gives:

>There are `r nrow(nepali)` observations in the `nepali` dataset. The average age is `r mean(nepali$age, na.rm = TRUE)` months.

# Working with Rmd files

## Running code

You can run code in chunks just like you can run code from a script (Ctrl-Return or the "Run" button). 

Also, you can run all the code in a chunk (or all the code in all chunks) using the different options under the "Chunks" button. These all also have keyboard shortcuts.

## Compiling to other formats

You can compile RMarkdown documents to other formats:

- Word
- Pdf (requires that you've installed "Tex" on your computer.)
- Slides (ioslides)

Click the button to the right of "Knit HTML" to see different options for rendering. 

## RPubs

You can freely post your RMarkdown documents:

[RPubs](http://rpubs.com)

If you want to post, you need to create an account. Once you do, you can click the "Publish" button on the top right of the window that pops up with your compiled file.

RPubs can also be a great place to look for interesting example code, although it looks like it's currently pretty overwhelmed with homework and Coursera examples.
