```

## Grading

Course grades will be determined by the following five components:

```{r echo = FALSE}
a <- data.frame(a = c("Final group project",
                      "Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2-9",
                      "Homework",
                      "Attendance and class participation",
                      "Weekly in-course group exercises"),
                b = c(30, 25, 25, 10, 10))
knitr::kable(a, col.names = c("Assessment component", 
                              "Percent of grade"))
```
